            Fancy seeing <strong><em class="italic bold">YOU</em></strong> here. :)
            You're probably on here cause you saw something sexy about this site. (AmIrite?)
            Well thank you for stopping by here and now let me describe who I am.</p>
            <p>Don't get lost in the maize.</p>

            <h2 class="heading">My name is Richard Jeane</h2>
            <p class="para">But you can call me Rajah639 or Ricky. Was born in the winter of 1990 which would make me
            26 at the time of writing this. </p>
            <p class="para"><strong>A little about myself</strong>; Well lets see, lets tell you about the teen years, I promise it will be brief.
            It was the winter of 2002 or so, a friend of mine had a pc and I used to sneak out every night just to get on for the night
            to play a video game. One night the parents found out and as upset as they were, with their help I had a pc of my own.
            Thus the begining of a beautiful relation started. Many nights went by, playing this game then eventually onto another well known
            pc game and my skills on the pc got sharper, finally I got curious into coding, websites, and just everything that made the
            computer go.</p>
            <p class="para">At the time of early adulthood, I started out on my own in a long string of jobs that made me personally saddend.
            From small construction jobs to retail jobs and just about everything else inbetween, as well as factory jobs, I switched
            over to focusing my time and efforts into studying, learn, practice and then ultimately help others learn to web design and develop
            with the tools that are at theirs (and mine) disposal.</p>
            <p class="para"> So now you know a little about my past and what has lead up to today. Perhaps I should explain current goals, challenges
             and skills.
             As we can see here; <strong class="bold">HTML</strong>, and <strong class="bold">CSS</strong> both are in use looking at this page; being aware of what each element can and can not do
             I can easily manipulate these boxes to provide an enjoyable expereience for you the viewer.
             For challenges; lets say it's more of a learning curve, as I am taking every day to practice and understand the fundamentals
             of <strong class="bold">JavaScript</strong>, and from there I would love to have a grasp of <strong class="bold">Modular JS</strong> and <strong class="bold">jQuery</strong> and progress from there on what ever
             team accepts me.</p>
