Updating portfolio with horrible projects from the last  few months. A lot I never finished to move onto different projects, in learning how to code.
Last few weeks how ever has been main focused on one scrapping tool for social media. 
I feel I should use other librarys but these files should help show my progress. 
Also, the training folder has been somewhat abandoned for more convience tool building, most of which is about understanding how to question what you are wanting the code to do, and with which library.
